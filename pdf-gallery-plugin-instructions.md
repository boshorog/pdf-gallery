# WordPress Plugin Packaging Instructions

## Creating a ZIP file for WordPress Plugin Upload

To create a WordPress plugin ZIP file that can be uploaded via **Add Plugins > Upload Plugin**:

### 1. Build the React App
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Create Plugin Directory Structure
Create a folder named `pdf-gallery` with the following structure:
```
pdf-gallery/
├── pdf-gallery-plugin.php
├── dist/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   ├── index.css
│   │   └── [other asset files]
│   └── index.html
└── README.txt (optional)
```

### 3. Copy Files
- Copy `pdf-gallery-plugin.php` to the root of `pdf-gallery/` folder
- Copy the entire `dist/` folder (generated by `npm run build`) to `pdf-gallery/dist/`

### 4. Create ZIP File
- Compress the `pdf-gallery/` folder into `pdf-gallery.zip`
- Make sure the plugin file `pdf-gallery-plugin.php` is in the root of the ZIP, not in a subfolder

### 5. Upload to WordPress
1. Go to **WordPress Admin > Plugins > Add New**
2. Click **Upload Plugin**
3. Choose `pdf-gallery.zip` 
4. Click **Install Now**
5. Activate the plugin

### Important Notes:
- The ZIP file must contain the plugin folder structure, not just the files
- WordPress will automatically extract to `wp-content/plugins/pdf-gallery/`
- The build configuration in `vite.config.ts` is already set for production path `/wp-content/plugins/pdf-gallery/dist/`
- No FTP upload needed when using this method

### Plugin Features:
- **Admin Access**: WordPress Admin > PDF Gallery
- **Frontend Display**: Use shortcode `[pdf_gallery]` 
- **Direct PDF Upload**: Upload PDF files directly from the admin interface
- **WordPress Media Integration**: Uploaded PDFs are stored in WordPress media library
